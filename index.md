# Optical Character Recognition
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:
```HTML

-The 2 main componenets of my project are the raspberry pi 4 and the camera that connects onto it. Aditionally, I used Visual Studio to create a virtual environment with the specific packages needed for my project, made a script called camera.py that sets up the Pi camera and takes a photo which is saved to the device. Also made a script for the program to process the images which I named example.py

- I learned why a virtual environemt was needed and how the terminal was used to connect to the raspberry pi without being physically connected. 

- One problem I ran into was errors while downloading the required packages. Even after reinstalling the OS on the Raspberry Pi, I kept having the same issue which was that the system couldn't detect the camera as a connected device. Another issue I faced was Visual Studios not connecting to the raspberry pi. 

  
- I resolved the package errors by installing them outside the virtual environment, which stopped the recurring issues. I also fixed the connection problem between Visual Studio Code and the Raspberry Pi by making sure the Pi was connected to my Wi-Fi network.
  
-I plan to integrate speech-to-text functionality into the project as well as a translation component to support multilingual input and output.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

example.py
```c++
import cv2
import pytesseract
import numpy as np
from pytesseract import Output
 
img_source = cv2.imread('coffee-ocr.jpg')
 
 
def get_grayscale(image):
    return cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
 
 
def thresholding(image):
    return cv2.threshold(image, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)[1]
 
 
def opening(image):
    kernel = np.ones((5, 5), np.uint8)
    return cv2.morphologyEx(image, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel)
 
 
def canny(image):
    return cv2.Canny(image, 100, 200)
 
 
gray = get_grayscale(img_source)
thresh = thresholding(gray)
opening = opening(gray)
canny = canny(gray)
 
i=0
for img in [img_source, gray, thresh, opening, canny]:
    d = pytesseract.image_to_data(img, output_type=Output.DICT)
    n_boxes = len(d['text'])
 
    # back to RGB
    if len(img.shape) == 2:
        img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2RGB)
 
    for i in range(n_boxes):
        if int(d['conf'][i]) > 60:
            (text, x, y, w, h) = (d['text'][i], d['left'][i], d['top'][i], d['width'][i], d['height'][i])
            # don't show empty text
            if text and text.strip() != "":
                img = cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)
                img = cv2.putText(img, text, (x, y - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1.2, (0, 255, 0), 3)
 
    cv2.imwrite(f'img{i}.jpg', img)
    i+=1
    cv2.waitKey(0)
```
-This script processes an image using various different techniques in order to detect and highlight readable text, then saves the results. It makes use of image processing and OCR tools to extract and display the text visually. The script simplifies the entire text detection process.

camera.py
```c++
from picamera2 import Picamera2
import cv2

# Initialize PiCam
picam2 = Picamera2()
picam2.configure(picam2.create_preview_configuration(main={"format": "RGB888", "size": (640, 480)}))
picam2.start()

# Capture one frame
frame = picam2.capture_array()

# Save the image to disk
cv2.imwrite("image.jpg", frame)

print("Image saved as image.jpg")
```


# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
